# Loan Payment Calculator
# The LoanCalculator application is a GUI-based program designed to assist users in calculating
# monthly and total payments for a loan based on provided input values. The graphical user interface (GUI)
# includes input fields for the annual interest rate (rateField), number of years (yearsField), and loan
# amount (loanAmountField), as well as output fields for the monthly payment (monthlyField) and total
# payment (totalField). A "Calculate" button initiates the calculation process. The application utilizes Java
# Swing components to create the GUI and handle user interactions.
